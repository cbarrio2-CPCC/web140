    <h1>Clerick Barrion WEB140-N801 Course Contract</h1>

    <p>I, Clerick Barrion agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2024 WEB140-N801 Web Development Tools with my instructor, Ella McManus.</p>

    <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>

    <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>

    <p>Signed: Clerick Barrion, Aug 19, 2024</p>
